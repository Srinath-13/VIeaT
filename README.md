VIeaT, which derives its inspiration from a standalone app for handling Food Ordering and Delivery process for VIT Chennai students, is an Online Food ordering and Delivery Portal. Therefore, this project is inspired from this idea and hopes to fulfil the requirements by 
developing a website prototype capable of managing food order from the sides of the 
customers, admin and the delivery person. The main highlight of the project is its database 
functionality. This food ordering website will be able to attract more customers by having a 
user-friendly Interface and a strong database. The website makes use of a powerful tech stack 
containing HTML, CSS, Java Script, PHP, MySQL and Bootstrap for efficient querying and 
user-friendly themes with a powerful Stripe Payment Integration.

## User Roles
This project comprises of an **admin** section to manage over all the aspects of the website, a 
**delivery person** section to manage the deliveries, and obviously the **user section** where they 
can make their favourite orders. This application is reduced as much as possible to avoid any 
sort of errors viz., redundancy and data insertion, deletion and modification. Thus, it will help 
both the organization and the user in the better utilization of the resources
